				How do you protect your hard earned money during a recession? What if fiat is inflating?
				What if the stock market is crashing? What if the housing bubble could burst at any time?
				What if your favorite crypto project is just hype without anything backing it up?
			</p>
			<p>
				In the wake of the 2022 recession, I asked myself these questions. For me, some form of
				diversification into different asset classes seemed sensible. Also assets which are backed
				by another asset looked very interesting to me. Or even better, an asset backed by other
				assets of different asset classes. While researching this topic, I quickly noticed the lack
				of information on backed assets. This is why I created this open-source project which seeks
				to build up a knowledge base and a community around the topic of asset backing.
