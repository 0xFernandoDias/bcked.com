How do you protect your hard earned money during a recession? What if fiat is inflating?
What if the stock market is crashing? What if the housing bubble could burst at any time?
What if your favorite crypto project is just hype without anything backing it up?

In the wake of the 2022 recession, I asked myself these questions. For me, some form of
diversification into different asset classes seemed sensible. Also cryptocurrencies which are backed
by another asset looked very interesting to me. Or even better, a cryptocurrency backed by other
assets of different asset classes. While researching this topic, I quickly noticed the lack
of information on backed cryptocurrencies. This is why I created this open-source project which seeks
to build up a knowledge base and a community around the topic of cryptocurrency backing.
